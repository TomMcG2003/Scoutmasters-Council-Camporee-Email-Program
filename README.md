# Scoutmasters-Council-Camporee-Email-Program
This code is what we use to automate the acceptance/delayed acceptance emails for our camporee

This code will get a sheet which it is connected to (must be a Google Sheet). It will then reach into the sheet, grab all of the headers (to include email recipients), format and email to send to them, and send it.
